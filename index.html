<h2>Dou dizhu</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Dou dizhu (simplified Chinese: 斗地主; traditional Chinese: 鬥地主; pinyin: dòu dìzhǔ; Jyutping: dau3 dei6 zyu2; lit. 'fighting the landlord') is a card game in the genre of shedding and gambling. It is one of the most popular card games played in China.</p>
<p>Dou dizhu is described as easy to learn but hard to master, requiring mathematical and strategic thinking as well as carefully planned execution. Suits are irrelevant in playing dou dizhu. Players can easily play the game with a set of dou dizhu playing cards, without the suits printed on the cards. Less popular variations of the game do exist in China, such as four-player and five-player dou dizhu played with two packs of cards.</p>
<h3>Rules:</h3>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>Dou dizhu is played among three people with one pack of cards, including the two differentiated jokers. The game starts with players bidding for the "landlord" (地主) position. Those who lose the bid or do not bid enter the game as the "peasants" (农民) team competing against the landlord. The objective of the game is to be the first player to have no cards left. The landlord wins by removing all their cards first. The peasants win if one of them removes all their cards first.
</p><br>
<h4>Game Play</h4>
<p>A shuffled pack of 54 cards is dealt to three players. Each player is dealt 17 cards, with the last three leftover cards detained on the playing desk, face down.</p>

<p>All players first review and apprise their own cards without showing their cards to the other players. Then, players take turns to bid for the landlord position by telling the other players the risk stake they are willing to accept.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of risk stakes, 1, 2, and 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. Generally, the more confident a player is in the strength of one's cards, the higher the risk stakes one is willing to bid. In most of the online game rooms, the first bidder is chosen randomly by the system. In real life, players usually make up their own rules as to who gets to bid first. For example, some rules stipulate that the player who has the three of hearts is the first bidder. If the three of hearts is in the "kitty" cards, the player who has the four of hearts is the first bidder, and so on.</p>

<p>A player may accept the prior player's bid by passing their turn to bid or one may try to outbid the prior player as long as the prior player did not bet 3 as the risk stake. The highest bidder takes the landlord position; the remaining players enter the Farmer team competing against the landlord. The three leftover wild cards are then revealed to all players before being dealt to the landlord.</p><br>
<h4>Basic Rules</h4>
<p>Individual cards are ranked: Colored Joker > Black & White Joker > 2 > Ace (A) > King (K) > Queen (Q) > Jack (J) > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3.</p>
<p>Suits are irrelevant: Players can play the game with all the suits erased from the cards.</p>
<p>Compare only the same Category: A player can only beat the prior hand using of the same Category but not the others. Note that this means that the ordering of the rows in the following table is not relevant to gameplay.</p>
<p>Compare only the Chains with the same length: Beat the prior hand using the same number of cards is a basic doctrine which only the Rocket and the Bomb may violate. For example, although both 9-10-J-Q-K and 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 are Single Chains, 9-10-J-Q-K cannot beat 3-4-5-6-7-8-9, nor vice versa.</p>
<p>Compare the rank in the Primal cards only: The Kicker's rank is irrelevant to the comparison unless a variation with 2+ decks is being played.</p>
<p>Jokers and 2 are non-consecutive cards: Colored Joker, black-and-white Joker, and 2 cannot be used in any of the Primal cards of the Chains since they are not traditionally considered as the consecutive cards sequentially next to the Ace. Examples of illegal Chain: 2-3-4-5-6, 2-2-2-3-3-3 w/ A-A-7-7, K-A-2 + B&W Joker + Colored Joker</p>
<p>About bombs: Only a bomb can beat other cards without following the same category, but if you want to beat other bombs, you need higher bombs to beat it</p><br>

<h4>Scoring Rules</h4>
<p>The basic mechanism is a betting one; the winner (or winners) take(s) money (points, whatever) from the loser(s). Moreover, the game may be seen as a pair of bets, each one between one of the peasants and the landlord. If the landlord wins, (s)he collects money from each of the peasants, and if the landlord loses, (s)he pays money to each of the peasants.</p>
<p>The bidding (one, two, or three) determines the initial stake, and gameplay can trigger two different categories of multiplier:</p>
<p>Rocket and/or bomb: Each rocket and bomb dealt by each player doubles the score in a round.</p>
<p>No deals played a.k.a. spring: If both peasants do not play any cards, or the landlord does not play any cards after their first hand, the round's score is doubled.</p>
<h5>Example: </h5>
<p>If the Peasants win, the score they win is base on how many cards the Landlord left. For example, the Landlord had left 8 card when Peasant1 finished playing all his or her cards. The Landlord called 2, there there are 1 bomb on this round. So the total score will be 8*2*2=32. One way is to let Peasant1 gain all the points. The other way is to let the two farmers share equally, so that Peasant1 and Peasant2 each gains 16 points for themselfs. The players can discuss how much money a point is worth. </p>
